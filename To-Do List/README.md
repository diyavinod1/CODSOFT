## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Python 3

Modules:

- time — for time delays and smoother user experience

- json — for storing and loading tasks

- os — for file handling

## 💡 How It Works

A menu is displayed with multiple options to manage tasks.

Tasks are stored in a tasks.json file automatically.
