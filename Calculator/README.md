# 🌈✨ Simple Calculator

<i>Beautifully minimal. Surprisingly powerful.</i>

<div align="center">

📟 A tiny Python calculator with smooth interactions and clean output.
It does the basics — but does them beautifully.

</div>

# 🌟 What It Does (and does well)

➕ Addition

➖ Subtraction

✖️ Multiplication

➗ Safe division (zero-proof 💥)

🔁 Continuous calculations

🚫 Rejects invalid choices without drama

Short, simple, and instantly usable.

# 🎮 How It Works

- Start the script

- Enter two numbers

- Pick your operation

- Get the result — fast

- Continue or exit as you like

Smooth. Predictable. Beginner-friendly.

# 🚀 Run It
python calculator.py

No installs. No configs.
Just Python — pure and clean.

# 🎨 Why It Looks Good

✨ Minimal CLI design

✨ Clean prompts and flow

✨ No noise, only essentials

✨ Perfect for beginners, portfolios, and DSA practice

✨ Small project → premium presentation

It’s the kind of project that says:
“I code clean.”

# 📌 Future Glow-Ups

- Modulus / power / square-root

- Input validation for alphabets

- Tkinter GUI

- Dark-mode styled CLI

- Flask version for the web

# 🌙 Why This Project Stands Out

This isn’t just a calculator —
it’s a reminder that even tiny projects can feel
intentional, aesthetic, and well-crafted.

Quality > complexity.
